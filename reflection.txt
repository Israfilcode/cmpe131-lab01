Using branches makes teamwork in coding much safer and easier. They let multiple developers work on different features at the same time without getting in each other’s way or damaging the main code. Everyone can create their own branch, try things out, and commit changes freely while the main branch stays stable. If something goes wrong or a bug is introduced, it only affects that one branch, not the entire project. Once the feature works properly and has been tested, it can be merged back into the main branch, keeping the project reliable.
Branches also help avoid common problems in team development. They prevent people from accidentally overwriting each other’s work, which can happen if everyone edits the main branch directly. They make it easier to understand who made specific changes and for what reason, since each branch has its own history. If a feature ends up not being useful, the branch can simply be removed without causing any harm. Branches also support code reviews, allowing teammates to check changes before merging them, which helps catch mistakes early and maintain overall code quality.
